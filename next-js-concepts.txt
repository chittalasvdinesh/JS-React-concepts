-Next.js:
 --Flexible react framework for creating fast and full stack web applications.


-Building blocks of a web application:
 --UI(users will consumer and interact with your application).
 --Routing(Navigating b/w diff parts of application).
 --Data fetching(How to get it).
 --Rendering(when and where to render the static/dynamic content).
 --Integrations(3rd party services usage and how to connect them (cms,auth,payments)).
 --Infrastructure(where to deploy,run,store your application).
 --Performance(how to optmise application for end users).
 --Scalability(how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.)
 --Developer experience(your team's experience building and maintaining your application.).


-React js?
  --Js library for building UI(what user can see and interact with on-screen).
  -- Building react requires some effort from Developers like spend time configuring tools and reinventing solutions for common application requirements.

-Next.js?
  --React framework for creating web applications.
  --By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.
  --Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, and caching - all while improving the developer and end-user experience.


-Rendering UI:
 --When a user visits a web page, the server returns an HTML file to the browser.
 --The browser then reads the HTML and constructs the Document Object Model (DOM).

--HTML vs DOM:
  -HTML:Initial page content.
  -DOM:Updated page content which can be changed by js.

  ex:

  // index.html

   <div id="app">

      </div>


  // index.js

const myApp=document.getElementById("app");
const myAppHeadingEl=document.createElement('h1');
const text="My APP Heading";
const headerContent=document.createTextNode(text);
myAppHeadingEl.appendChild(headerContent);
myApp.appendChild(myAppHeadingEl)


--Imperative vs declarative programming:
 -Imperative: writing the steps for how the user interface should be updated. (like DOM method in above example).
 -declarative: able to declare what they want to show 

 ex:imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza.
  Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. 


-React is the popular declarative library for building UI.

- react= A core library.
- react-dom= provides DOM methods to use React with dom.

ex:
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
      root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>);


-browsers don't understand JSX out of the box, so you'll need a JavaScript compiler, such as a Babel, to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript.



-Next.js

1.Installation command:

    npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest -->to existing html project

    npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app

    npm run dev -->to start tge local server

2.Routing
Next.js uses file-system routing. This means that instead of using code to define the routes of your application, you can use folders and files.


--Server and client components:

  - Environment: application code executed in server and the client.
  - Network boundary: seperates the server code and client code.

  - components are split into two module graphs.
   1.server module graph or tree (server components rendered on server)
   2.client module graph or tree (client components rendered on client)


-After Server Components are rendered, a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC) is sent to the client.
 The RSC payload contains:

    1.The rendered result of Server Components.
    2.Placeholders (or holes) for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files.

-React uses this information to consolidate the Server and Client Components and update the DOM on the client.

-Next.js uses  react Server Components by default


-the React 'use client' directive at the top of the file. This tells React to render the component on the client.

    ex:

    'use client'

    import { useState } from 'react';
    
    export default function LikeButton() {
    const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
    
    function handleClick() {
        setLikes(likes + 1);
    }
    
    return <button onClick={handleClick}>Like ({likes})</button>;
    }


- you should notice the browser automatically updates to reflect the change.
  This feature is called Fast Refresh. It gives you instantaneous feedback on any edits you make and comes pre-configured with Next.js.


-Dashboard project using next.js

npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"

-Folder structure

    /app: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
    /app/lib: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
    /app/ui: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
    /public: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
    /scripts: Contains a seeding script that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.
    Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.




-You can import global.css in any component in your application, but it's usually good practice to add it to your top-level component. In Next.js, this is the root layout.

 Add global styles to your application by navigating to /app/layout.tsx and importing the global.css file:

 ex:

 import '@/app/ui/global.css';

 -CSS Modules allow you to scope CSS to a component by automatically creating unique class names,
  so you don't have to worry about style collisions as well.

-clsx is a utility library commonly used in React applications to conditionally apply CSS classes.
 It helps simplify the process of managing dynamic class names based on certain conditions or props in your React components.

 --npm install clsx

    ex:

    import clsx from 'clsx';
    
    export default function InvoiceStatus({ status }: { status: string }) {
    return (
        <span
        className={clsx(
            'inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm',
            {
            'bg-gray-100 text-gray-500': status === 'pending',
            'bg-green-500 text-white': status === 'paid',
            },
        )}
        >
        // ...
    )}


-Optimizing Fonts and Images:
-fonts:
Next.js automatically optimizes fonts in the application when you use the next/font module. It downloads font files at build time and hosts them with your other static assets. 
This means when a user visits your application, there are no additional network requests for fonts which would impact performance.

ex:

//font.ts:
import { Inter, Lusitana } from 'next/font/google';

export const lusitana = Lusitana({ subsets: ['latin'], weight: ["400","700"] });

//page.tsx:
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';


 <p className={`${lusitana.className} text-xl text-gray-800 md:text-3xl md:leading-normal`} >


-The <Image> component:
    The <Image> Component is an extension of the HTML <img> tag, and comes with automatic image optimization like:
    Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.
    Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport.
    Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport).

    -It is good practice to give width and height to the Image.


-Creating Layouts and Pages:
    --Nested routing
        Next.js uses file-system routing where folders are used to create nested routes. 
        Each folder represents a route segment that maps to a URL segment.
